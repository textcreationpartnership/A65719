            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

                     <p>This Propoſition, That the Doctrines and pretended Traditions of the Weſtern Church could not be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troduced by her Members in following Ages, but muſt be derived to them from the Fountain of Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition, is proved falſe, 1. By plain Inſtances of matters of Fact, §. 1. 2ly. From the falſe Doctrines and Traditions which generally obtained in the Jewiſh Church, §. 2. 3ly. From the Prediction of a general Defection from the Faith in the times of <hi>Antichriſt,</hi> §. 3. 4ly. Becauſe this Aſſertion doth oblige us to account the Fathers of the primitive Ages either Knaves or Fools, §. 4. 5ly. Becauſe it renders all our Search into Antiquity, not only ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perfluous but dangerous, §. 5. Corruptions in Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine or Practice might take their Riſe, 1ſt. From Miſtakes touching the Sence of Scripture, §. 6. 2ly. By leaving of the Scripture and ſetting up the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers as the Rule of Faith, §. 7. 3ly. By flying to Miracles and Viſions for the eſtabliſhment of Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrines and Opinions, §. 8. 4ly. By reaſon of the
<pb n="vi" facs="tcp:59808:4"/>great Authority and Reputation of thoſe Men who firſt began, or elſe gave Countenance unto them, §. 9. 5ly. By reaſon of the corrupt Manners of the Clergy, §. 10. 6ly. By reaſon of the great Ignorance both of the Clergy and the People, §. 11. 7ly. By reaſon of the Violence and Perſecution uſed to force Men to a Compliance with the prevailing Doctrines, or a concealment of their Sentiments to the contrary, §. 12. This Corruption confeſſed by the Writers of the dark Ages of the Church, §. 13.</p>
                  </argument>
                  <p>
                     <hi>THAT which the</hi> Romaniſts <hi>of late have chiefly urged in favour of their preſent Doctrines and Traditions, is, That the</hi> Traditions <hi>which they now embrace as ſuch, the</hi> Doctrines <hi>which they own as Articles of</hi> Chriſtian <hi>Faith, could never have obtained ſuch Credit in the</hi> Church, <hi>or been ſo generally received throughout the</hi> Weſtern Churches <hi>as they were before the</hi> Reformation, <hi>had they not been from the Beginning handed down to them as</hi> Apoſtolical Traditions <hi>and Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrines received by the</hi> Univerſal Church <hi>of</hi> Chriſt.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Now the Vanity and Falſhood of this Preſumption is here ſhewed by many Inſtances of plain matter of Fact,
<label type="milestone">
                           <seg type="milestoneunit">§. </seg>1</label> demonſtrating that what they of</hi> Rome <hi>at preſent hold for</hi> Apoſtolical Tradition, <hi>or as an Article of</hi> Chriſtian <hi>Faith, was generally rejected in former Ages by the whole</hi> Church <hi>of</hi> Chriſt, <hi>or at the leaſt by the prevailing, and the major part of her</hi> Church Guides: <hi>And whereas it is repreſented by them as a thing impoſſible, That the</hi> Weſtern Church, <hi>or the prevailing Body of it, ſhould in one Age imbrace what they in the foregoing did reject; or in this Age reject, what in the former they embraced, Examples are produced here, demonſtrating that this hath actually
<pb n="vii" facs="tcp:59808:4"/>happened in the Inſtance of</hi> eating things ſtrangled, and Blood,

                        <hi>Chap.</hi> 2. §. 6.</note> 
                     <hi>which the whole</hi> Weſtern Church <hi>abominated in the Eleventh Century, and yet did practiſe in the Twelfth and following</hi> Ages. <hi>In the Inſtance of</hi> the immaculate Conception <hi>denyed by the</hi> Weſtern Church <hi>till the Thir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teenth Century,

                           <hi>Ibid.</hi> §. 9.</note> and almoſt generally received in the Fif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teenth and Sixteenth Centuries. In the Inſtance of the</hi> Canonical <hi>and</hi> Apocryphal Books <hi>of the</hi> Old Teſtament <hi>in which the Learned of the</hi> Weſtern Church <hi>accorded with us in the Fourteenth and Fifteenth Centuries,

                     <hi>aſſerted generally in the firſt Four</hi> Centuries, <hi>and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jected in the Fifth, to omit many other Inſtances ſufficient to convince us that what the</hi> Romaniſts <hi>ſo confidently offer to prove their</hi> Church, <hi>could not be guilty of ſuch Innovations, is only like to the Attempt of</hi> Zeno <hi>to prove, againſt plain matter of Fact, that there could be no Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>But for the farther manifeſtation of the Vanity of this new way of Arguing</hi> a facto ad jus, <hi>from what they do at preſent practiſe and believe, to what they ought to do and practiſe, or from their preſent Faith, to an Aſſurance that the ſame Faith was always held in all preceeding Ages of the</hi> Church: <hi>I ſhall,</hi>

                  </p>
                  <p>Secondly, <hi>I ſhall point out the Ways and Methods by which theſe Doctrines and Practices might have pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vailed in the</hi> Church, <hi>and yet be nothing leſs than</hi> Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtolical, <hi>or truly</hi> Primitive.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>The evil Conſequences of this way of Arguing, are,</hi>

                     <hi>That it gives the</hi> Jews <hi>a great Advantage againſt the Truth, and certainty of</hi> Chriſtian <hi>Faith; for they might have then argued, and ſtill may, with as much Plauſibility againſt our</hi> Lord<hi>'s Diſciples, and the first</hi> Chriſtian <hi>Converts, from this very Topick, as do the</hi> Romaniſts <hi>againſt the</hi> Proteſtants.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>For might they not ſay of the very Doctrines and Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditions which they had generally received at our</hi> Saviour<hi>'s Advent, and which he did ſo peremptorily condemn, and caution his</hi> Diſciples <hi>to beware of,</hi>

                        <hi>That they received them from their</hi> Fore-Fathers, <hi>who received them from theirs, and who must either have joined in miſtaking their</hi> Anceſtors, <hi>or in intending to deceive their Poſterity, of which two things neither is credible? Might not they ſay, That the Traditions which they had then embraced, were derived from</hi> Moſes, <hi>and that their</hi> Fore-Fathers <hi>handed them down from him to them, and that the then preſent general Reception of them was a ſufficient Evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence that they were not Inventions of that, or any of the preceeding Ages, but Doctrines and Practices de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rived to them from the firſt Fountain of Tradition? Might they not have asked in what Year and Age thoſe falſe Traditions and Doctrines entered first among them, and whether then their whole</hi> Church <hi>muſt not have con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpired to tell a lye? Might they not have bid them con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider the Notoriouſneſs of the Lye, and the Damage en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuing from it to themſelves and their deareſt Pledges, and how rare a thing it is to find a Man, much leſs a conſiderable Number of them, who would venture upon ſuch a Wickedneſs?

                  <p>Firſt, <hi>Is it not wonderful to ſee how theſe Men ſay and unſay, pronounce a thing impoſſible in one Caſe, and in another, like unto it, confeſs it actually done? We ſhew them, That in the</hi> Jewiſh Church <hi>ſuch falſe</hi> Traditions <hi>had generally prevail'd, as tended to</hi> evacuate the Law of God, <hi>render his</hi> Worſhip vain, <hi>and to engage them to reject the true</hi> Meſſiah; <hi>and yet they were received as Doctrines of their great Prophet</hi> Moſes, <hi>handed down to them by</hi> oral Tradition, <hi>that</hi> infallible <hi>Preſerver of Truth: True, ſay they, the</hi> Church Guides <hi>were then</hi> permitted by God to be the greateſt Enemies of Truth, and guided therein, not by Gods, but a Satanical Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit; <hi>add now to this, That the Doctrines and</hi> Traditions <hi>of theſe Men found</hi> general <hi>Reception in the</hi> Jewiſh Church: <hi>And will it not hence follow, That Doctrines taught, Traditions introduced by the greateſt</hi> Enemies of Truth, <hi>and by Men acted,</hi> not by the Spirit of God, but that of Satan, <hi>may generally prevail to be received as true Doctrines and Traditions, derived from</hi> propheti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal Authority, <hi>and fit to be aſſented to, received and practiſed by all?</hi>

                  <p>Secondly, <hi>Did theſe Traditions and falſe Doctrines, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt which our</hi> Saviour <hi>cautioned them, begin then only to ſpring up among them when our</hi> Saviour <hi>appeared with his</hi> Miracles, <hi>when, at his</hi> Baptiſm the Holy Ghoſt <hi>deſcended viſibly upon him, and God gave Teſtimony to him by</hi> a Voice from Heaven? <hi>If ſo, you ſee that even the whole</hi> Jewiſh Church, <hi>though ſcattered throughout the World, might all at once embrace</hi> Traditions <hi>of ſuch evil and pernici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Conſequences, though they before had never heard one tittle of them; and ſo not only in the Compaſs of one

                     <p n="2">2. It follows, that it is ſo far from being impoſſible, that it is actually certain, That what was never heard of, yea what
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:59808:54"/>was generally contradicted in the former Ages of the <hi>Church,</hi> may afterwards be owned by the <hi>general</hi> conſent of learned, and unlearned <hi>Romaniſts;</hi> in ſpite of all the Treatiſes <hi>of the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petuity of the Faith,</hi> and of the <hi>lawful prejudices</hi> againſt the <hi>Cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viniſts.</hi>

                     <p n="3">3. Hence it is evident, that the <hi>Church</hi> of <hi>Rome</hi> doth not in all things follow the Doctrine of the <hi>Ancient Catholick Church;</hi> for if ſo, then would not they have given liberty to all their Members to oppoſe a Doctrine generally Believed, and Taught in the whole <hi>Catholick Church,</hi> and more aſſuredly in the whole <hi>Weſtern Church,</hi> for Eight whole <hi>Centuries.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p n="4">4.

                     <p n="5">5. Hence doth it follow, that even by the <hi>Authority</hi> of the heads of the <hi>

For, 1. The neceſſary Articles of Chriſtian Faith, and Rules of Chriſtian Life were preached univerſally to all; and ſo there was no time when any Chriſtian could be ignorant of them without his own fault, but the <hi>Epiſtles</hi> controverted were only ſent to private Chriſtians, as the Second and Third <hi>Epiſtles</hi> of St. <hi>John;</hi> or to the Churches of the <hi>Jews,</hi> and therefore might with reaſon for ſome time be doubted of by other Churches of the <hi>Gentiles,</hi> this being not a weakening, but confirmation of
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:59808:66"/>our Faith, that the firſt Chriſtians were ſo careful to ſee ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient Evidence before they would receive even the leaſt <hi>Epiſtle</hi> into the <hi>Canon</hi> of the <hi>Scripture.</hi> 2. No <hi>Chriſtian Church</hi> could need to be told by any other what were the neceſſary <hi>Articles</hi> of Chriſtian Faith, or Rules of Life, ſince they muſt always know the Chriſtian Faith, and be obliged to practiſe the Rules of Chriſtian Piety, and muſt be taught them by their <hi>Church Guides;</hi> but 'tis not thus with reference to theſe <hi>Epiſtles,</hi> for being writ to a particular Society of <hi>Chriſtians,</hi> it was ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient that this <hi>Society</hi> could ſhew,

It is evident from the ſecond Obſervation, that the aſſured knowledge that theſe <hi>Epiſtles</hi> are <hi>Canonical,</hi> cannot be neceſſary to Salvation, the neceſſary Doctrines of Chriſtian Faith being according to the general <hi>Tradition</hi> of the whole Church of <hi>Chriſt,</hi>

                     <p n="1">1.

                     <p>But ſaith Mr. <hi>M. Before we can know true Books,

                     <p>This Objection I retort thus,

                        </label> before we can know true <hi>Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition</hi> from falſe, we muſt know true Faith from falſe; for true <hi>Tradition</hi> is only the <hi>Tradition</hi> of the <hi>Faithful,</hi> that is, of thoſe who do entirely believe all the neceſſary <hi>Articles</hi> of <hi>Chriſtian</hi> Faith, and if I muſt firſt know this Faith, before I can know <hi>true Tradition,</hi> I cannot need <hi>Tradition</hi> to inſtruct me in the <hi>Chriſtian</hi> Faith.

                     <p>And 'tis as evident from our <hi>Lord</hi>'s anſwer, <hi>Elias cometh firſt, i. e.</hi> before my Reſurrection of which I now ſpeak; from this place therefore it never can be proved, that any other, under that <hi>Character,</hi> is to appear before his ſecond coming.</p>

                     <p>
                        <hi>Firſt,</hi> We have it from <hi>Tradition,</hi> That preſently after the <hi>Apoſtles</hi> times all Churches were governed by <hi>Biſhops,</hi> preſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding over <hi>Presbyters</hi> and <hi>Deacons,</hi> as their lawful Governors; whence we inferr we have juſt Reaſon to believe this form of Government was <hi>Apoſtolical,</hi> ſince otherwiſe the Government
<pb n="121" facs="tcp:59808:96"/>left in all <hi>Churches</hi> by the <hi>Apoſtles,</hi> muſt, in the immediate fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing Age, have been not only changed, but corrupted eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry where. But that in the frame and Subſtance of the eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſhed Government of the <hi>Church,</hi> a thing always in uſe and practice, there ſhould be ſo ſuddain a Change, ſo univerſal a Corruption, in ſo ſhort a time; and that all <hi>Chriſtians,</hi> with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the leaſt Oppoſition that we read of,
<note place="margin">De praeſcript. c. 28.</note> ſhould conſpire in this Corruption, is a thing morally impoſſible: For, as <hi>Tertullian</hi> argues in like Caſe, <hi>Variaſſe debuerat Error doctrinae Eccleſiarum; quod autem apud omnes unum eſt, non eſt erratum, ſed traditum: What all Chriſtian Churches did ſo early agree in practiſing <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formly, came not by Error, but Tradition.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Moreover it is clearly proved by the moſt learned <hi>Biſhop</hi> of <hi>Cheſter,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">L. 2. c. 13 pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ma Aſſertio. p. 157, &amp;c.</note> That the Writers of the Second Century diſtinctly mention the ſeveral Orders of <hi>Biſhops,</hi> and their inferior <hi>Presbyters</hi> in the ſame <hi>Church,</hi> and thereby give us Reaſon to conclude that this Diſparity was generally ſetled in that Age. Now how improbable it is, that either ſuch a Change, as muſt be here ſuppoſed, were this an Innovation, ſhould happen unadviſedly, or thorough Negligence, or that the whole <hi>Church</hi> ſhould have conſpired ſo early to ſwerve from the eſtabliſhed Order, by placing <hi>Biſhops</hi> above <hi>Presbyters</hi> without Complaint, or the Reſiſtance of any ſingle Perſon that we hear of, will appear, if we conſider,</p>
                     <p n="1">1. The Subjects of this Conſtitution, <hi>viz.</hi> The Perſons ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed by the <hi>Apoſtles</hi> to govern and preſide in every <hi>Church,</hi> they being conſtant Objects of every Perſons common Sence, ſeen in every <hi>Aſſembly,</hi> imploy'd in every <hi>eccleſiaſtical</hi> Affair, publick and private, in which all Chriſtians, Sick or Well, Living or Dying, were concerned, we may reaſonably con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive that which ſome of the <hi>Apostles,</hi> to gain upon the <hi>Jews,</hi> did obſerve the <hi>Chriſtian</hi> Feaſt of <hi>Eaſter</hi> on the Fourteenth Day of the Moon, others might have miſtaken this compli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance, as if the <hi>Apoſtles</hi> had judged that the fitteſt time for <hi>Chriſtians</hi> of ſucceeding <hi>Ages</hi> to obſerve it in, or that when they heard of an <hi>Elias</hi> to come <hi>before the terrible Day of the Lord,</hi> or of <hi>the Reign of Chriſt on Earth a Thouſand Years,</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſented to St. <hi>John</hi> in a <hi>Viſion;</hi> they might miſtake the ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuine import of thoſe <hi>Scriptures,</hi> and of others of like nature; but in a matter of this kind, which was the daily object of
<pb n="122" facs="tcp:59808:97"/>the Senſes of all <hi>Chriſtians,</hi> we cannot eaſily conceive how they could poſſibly miſtake, and not perceive that ſuch a change was made, if really it was done.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. We ſhall be more convinced that this was not per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed by Conſpiracy, or by a joint conſent of <hi>Christians</hi> to make ſo great an alteration in that form of Government which the <hi>Apoſtles</hi> had eſtabliſhed, if we conſider,</p>
                     <p n="1">1. The general agreement of all <hi>Churches</hi> in this matter, ſince not one ſingle <hi>Church</hi> or Corner of the world can be produced in which this Government did not obtain. For how can we imagine that in a time when no <hi>General Council,</hi> could meet to appoint it, and when there was no <hi>Chriſtian Prince</hi> to ſet it forward on a political Account, and when, by reaſon of the heat of Perſecution, and the diſtance of <hi>Chriſtian Churches,</hi> there was ſo little commerce, and intercourſe between them, from the <hi>Churches</hi> of <hi>Armenia</hi> and <hi>Perſia</hi> in the <hi>East,</hi> to thoſe of <hi>Spain</hi> in the <hi>Weſt;</hi> from the <hi>African Churches</hi> in the <hi>South,</hi> to our <hi>Britiſh Churches</hi> in the <hi>North,</hi> this conſtitution ſhould have been univerſally received and ſubmitted to, if it had not been eſtabliſhed by the <hi>Apostles,</hi> or the firſt <hi>Founders</hi> of thoſe <hi>Churches?</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p n="2">2. If we conſider how much it did concern all <hi>Chriſtians</hi> that ſuch an Innovation ſhould not obtain among them, and tamely be ſubmitted to. For all the people were obliged to know the <hi>Governors</hi> to whom they were by <hi>Scripture</hi> commanded to ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit, and ſo they could not yield to this ſuppoſed Innovation without the greateſt danger to their Souls: The <hi>Preſbyters,</hi> if they had by the <hi>Apostles</hi> been advanced to the higheſt Power, would not ſo meekly have ſubmitted to an Authority uſurped over them, but either out of a juſt Zeal for aſſerting their Freedom, or out of Indignation at the inſolence of the u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurping <hi>Biſhops,</hi> or out of an unwillingneſs to ſubmit and obey, which is natural to moſt Men, they would have aſſerted their Equality.</p>
                     <p n="3">3. This will be farther evident if we conſider that even the perſons thus exalted could have then no motive or temptation to accept of this advancement; for Men do not uſually deſire a change but upon proſpect of ſome eaſe or temporal Advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage, much leſs when they perceive the Change is only like to add to their trouble, and encreaſe their danger, now this was
<pb n="123" facs="tcp:59808:97"/>really the caſe of the firſt <hi>Chriſtian Biſhops,</hi> they being ſtill ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed to the ſharpeſt fury of their Perſecutors, and commonly begun with firſt in any ſtorm that was raiſed againſt the <hi>Church;</hi> their Labours alſo were very great, for the care of the Flock lay on them, and they were unwearied in the diſcharge of their <hi>Paſtoral</hi> Care; can we then reaſonably think that they ſhould be ſo fond of ſo much toil and peril, as to violate the Inſtitution of the <hi>Bleſſed Jeſus</hi> or his <hi>Apostles</hi> to obtain it.</p>
                     <p>Let any reaſonable Perſon duly weigh theſe things, and ask his Conſcience, whether it can be really perſwaded that ſuch an early Innovation could generally have prevailed in the <hi>Church</hi> of <hi>God.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Such alſo is the Evidence that we pretended to,

                     <p>
                        <hi>Firſt,</hi> That we have the true <hi>Canon</hi> of the <hi>Old Teſtament,</hi> and that the <hi>Books</hi> of the <hi>Old Teſtament</hi> are not corrupted, we cannot know from the <hi>Infallibility</hi> of the <hi>Jewiſh Church</hi> or her <hi>Traditions;</hi> for when ſhe handed down theſe <hi>Scriptures</hi> to the <hi>Chriſtians,</hi> as the pure word of their inſpired <hi>Prophets,</hi> ſhe was not Infallible, but actually had renounced her true <hi>Meſſiah,</hi> and judged him an <hi>Impoſtor,</hi> and had embraced ſuch falſe <hi>Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditions</hi> as did engage her ſo to do. So that if,

                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Secondly,</hi>
                        <label type="milestone">
                           <seg type="milestoneunit">§. </seg>9</label> That the Books of the <hi>New Teſtament</hi> are not corrupted or forged, we cannot know from the <hi>Infallibility</hi> of the <hi>Chriſtian Church.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>The Reaſon is becauſe the <hi>Infallibility</hi> of the <hi>Church</hi> is ſo far from being a proof of <hi>Scriptures</hi> incorruption, that no proof can be pretended for it but uncorrupted places of <hi>Scripture.</hi> For if any man ſhould attempt to prove the <hi>Scriptures</hi> uncor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupted, <hi>becauſe that Church ſays ſo, which is Infallible,</hi> I would
<pb n="124" facs="tcp:59808:98"/>demand of him, ſeeing the Infallibility of the <hi>Church</hi> is not ſelf-evident, and ſeeing <hi>Infallibility</hi> is a Prerogative which no Man can pretend to but from God's Aſſiſtance, and therefore no Man can be ſure of that Aſſiſtance but from God's free Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe, how ſhall I be aſſured of her Infallibility? If he ſay from <hi>Scripture,</hi> promiſing it unto her, I would ask how ſhall I be aſſured that the <hi>Scriptures</hi> are not corrupted in thoſe places; and if to this it be anſwered, From the <hi>Church</hi>'s <hi>Infal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>libility,</hi> is it not evident that he runs in a Circle, proving the <hi>Scripture's</hi> incorruption by the <hi>Church</hi>'s Infallibility, and the <hi>Church</hi>'s Infallibility by the <hi>Scripture's</hi> incorruption. More<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>over, this is further evident from the <hi>Tradition,</hi> Practice, and Acknowledgment of the whole <hi>Church</hi> of <hi>Chriſt,</hi> for to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form us in any controverted <hi>Text,</hi> which is the Reading to be owned as true; her <hi>Doctors</hi> never have ſent us to <hi>Oral Tradi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,</hi> or the infallible Aſſiſtance of the <hi>Church,</hi> but always to the readings of former <hi>Ancient Authors,</hi> and to the Inſpection of <hi>ancient Manuſcripts</hi> and Verſions, and have declared what in it ſelf is manifeſt, and owned by all that ever treated on this Subject, That <hi>there is no other way whereby we can attain to any knowledge or aſſurance in this matter.</hi> Thus <hi>Sixtus Quintus</hi> in his Preface to his Bible,
<note place="margin">In hac Ger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mani Textus perveſtigati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>one ſatis per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpicue inter omnes conſtat nullum eſſe certius ac firmius Argumentum quam Antiquorum probatorum codicum Latinorum fidem.</note> tells us, That <hi>in Perveſtigation of the true and genuine Text, it was perſpicuous to all Men, that there was no Argument more firm and certain, than the Faith of ancient Latin Books.</hi>

                     <p>This ſure can be conceived Rational by none, but ſuch as think it not abſurd to ſay, That God repented of his good Will and Kindneſs to Mankind, in the vouchſafing of the <hi>Goſpel</hi> to them.</p>
                     <p>That he ſo far maligned the good of future Generations, that he ſuffered wicked Men to rob them of all the benefit intended to them by this Declaration of his Will.

                     <p>I anſwer, 1.

                     <p>If then no Writing whilſt the <hi>Apostles</hi> lived could paſs for <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtolical,</hi> and yet deſtroy or contradict the Faith they taught; — if their immediate <hi>Succeſſors</hi> could not be ignorant of what the <hi>Apoſtles</hi> committed to them to be read and taught, us the <hi>Records</hi> of their Faith and Doctrine; nor would they be induced to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liver that for ſuch which they believed not to be ſo, if neither they could univerſally conſpire to effect this thing; nor can it rationally be thought that <hi>Providence</hi> would ſuffer them to do ſo: 'Tis morally impoſſible theſe Writings ſhould be forged or corrupted in matters of Concern or Moment.</p>

From the unanimous and uncontroulled Teſtimony of the Fathers from the firſt and pureſt Ages of the Church, §. 4. And ſhewing, <hi>Secondly,</hi> That the Apoſtles were commiſſionated from the Lord Chriſt, or were directed by his Spirit to appoint this a day of publick Worſhip in Honour of our Lord, and in remembrance of his Reſurrection, §. 5. The Romaniſts can ſhew no ſuch Tradition for any of the conteſted Doctrines, §. 6. Mr. <hi>M</hi>'s. Argument retorted againſt the ſufficiency of Tradition to eſtabliſh this Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine, by ſhewing that there is no Tradition for abſtain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing wholly from ſervile Work upon that Day, but rather the contrary, §. 7. The not obſerving of this Day through ignorance of our Obligation ſo to do, is not deſtructive of Salvation, §. 8. The Command for remembring the Seventh Day from the Creation to reſt upon it from all manner of Work, was Ceremonial and not Moral; this proved, 1ſt. From Reaſon, §. 9. 2dly. From the Words and Actions of our Saviour, §. 10. 3dly. From <hi>Gal.</hi> iv. 10, 11. §. 11. 4thly. From <hi>Col.</hi> ij. 14, 16, 17. §. 12. 5thly.

His third Objection, That Saint <hi>Paul</hi> frequented Synagogues on the Sabbath Day, Anſwered, §. 16. His fourth Objection, That in Chriſt Jeſus nothing avails but keeping the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandments of God, Anſwered, §. 17.

                  </argument>
                  <p>
                     <hi>IN this Diſcourſe I have endeavoured to ſhew in what Sence we admit of Tradition as a ſufficient Evidence of the Truth of what we do believe, or practiſe: And have demonſtrated, That in thoſe things which we receive upon her Teſtimony the</hi> Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maniſts <hi>cannot pretend unto a like Tradition for any of their Doctrines. Two things they farther do object againſt us as in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances of things neceſſary to be believed, which yet, ſay they, have no Foundation in the</hi> Holy Scriptures, <hi>and therefore must be be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieved only on the account of</hi> Tradition, <hi>or the</hi> Authority <hi>of the</hi> Church; viz.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, <hi>The Obſervation of the</hi> Lord's Day, <hi>and the liberty we take in working on the</hi> Sabbath, <hi>and not obſerving it as a day ſet apart unto the Service of the Creator of the World.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Secondly, <hi>The Baptiſm of</hi> Infants, <hi>of which, what Mr.</hi> M. <hi>offers is ſufficiently conſidered in the following Treatiſe, and the practice hath of late been fully juſtified from</hi> Scripture <hi>and</hi> Tradi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, <hi>jointly, by Three learned Treatiſes, to which I ſhall referr the Reader.
<note place="margin">Mr. <hi>Walker</hi>'s Modeſt Plea for Infants Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptiſm. The Caſe of Infants Baptiſm. Dr. <hi>Still.</hi> Rational Account. <hi>Part.</hi> 1. <hi>cap.</hi> 4.</note> Touching the firſt particular, I ſhall Diſcourſe at pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent in this Preface, and ſhew in oppoſition to Mr.</hi> Mumford, <hi>that we have ſufficient Ground from Scripture for obſerving the</hi> Lord's Day, <hi>and not obſerving of the</hi> Sabbath <hi>Day; and that, as far as we depend upon Tradition in theſe Points, the</hi> Romaniſts <hi>can ſhew no like</hi> Tradition <hi>for their Tenets. To begin with the firſt of theſe particulars; That</hi> the Lord's Day is by all Chriſtians to be ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved as a Religious Feſtival, <hi>will be made good from theſe Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderations.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Firſt, <hi>That it is mentioned in the</hi> Scripture <hi>as a known Feſtival Day, a Day which bore</hi> Chriſt<hi>'s Name, a Day on which the</hi>
                     <pb n="vij" facs="tcp:59808:107"/>Chriſtians <hi>did aſſemble for the performance of Sacred and Religious Worſhip.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Secondly, <hi>That it was perpetually and univerſally obſerved as ſuch by the</hi> Catholick Church <hi>including the times of the</hi> Apoſtles. <hi>And,</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Firſt, <hi>That</hi> it is mentioned in Scripture as a known Feſtival Day, a Day which bore Chriſt's Name, a Day on which the Chriſtians did aſſemble for the performance of Religious Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip, <hi>will appear,</hi>

                  </p>
                  <p n="2">2dly. <hi>Whereas</hi> Saint John, <hi>to denote the time when he received his</hi> Viſion, <hi>ſaith, It was</hi> on the Lord's Day: <hi>It follows that this Day must be a Day well known; otherwiſe he could not by this note ſufficiently declare the</hi> Time <hi>when he received his</hi> Viſion: <hi>Since then the firſt Day of the Week, and that alone was by the</hi> Chriſtians <hi>of the firſt Ages ſtiled the</hi> Lord's Day, <hi>and known to them familiarly by that Name, it is rational to conclude, That the</hi> Apoſtle <hi>by this Phraſe did underſtand the firſt Day of the Week.

                  <p>Firſt, <hi>That they were made upon ſuch Grounds and Reaſons as equally concern the whole</hi> Church <hi>of all Ages, and there hath happened ſince no alteration of Circumſtances, which made it reaſonable then to obſerve, what now we have no Reaſon to perform:</hi> v. g. <hi>The</hi> Anointing of the Sick <hi>was a Ceremony annexed to the extraor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary Gift of Healing, which ceaſing, this Appendix of it ceaſed with it, not by any repeal of the</hi> Church, <hi>but by expiration; as all the Conſtitutions of Saint</hi> Paul, <hi>touching</hi> the uſe of Tongues, <hi>did with the failure of that Gift. The Law which obliged the</hi> Gentile <hi>to</hi> abſtain from things Strangled, and Blood, <hi>was de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigned only to avoid offending the weak</hi> Jew; <hi>there being there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore none ſuch now, nor any hopes remaining of their Conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion by this Abſtinence, that Law muſt ceaſe, not by a poſitive repeal, but by ceſſation of the Cauſe, or Reaſon of it, according to thoſe known Rules,</hi> Sublatâ cauſâ tollitur effectus, &amp; ratio
<pb n="xviij" facs="tcp:59808:113"/>legis eſt lex, Take away the Cauſe, and the Effect ceaſeth.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, <hi>When they are not about ſome leſſer Ceremonies or Circumſtances, which in tract of time may become ſubject to abuſe and hindrance, to a greater good; and for that reaſon may be diſpenſed with, and abrogated by the</hi> Church, <hi>by virtue of that general Rule of</hi> doing all things to Edification, <hi>but about Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters of great Moment, ſuch as concern the Service of our Great</hi> Maſter, <hi>and the time to be ſet apart for the performance of it. For Inſtance, touching</hi> the Kiſs of Charity, <hi>all that</hi> Saint Paul <hi>or</hi> Peter <hi>have delivered concerning it is this, That ſome times or other</hi> Chriſtians <hi>ſhould teſtifie their mutual affection to each other by a Kiſs; and that this Kiſs be not a wanton or diſſembling one, but an</hi> Holy <hi>one, or a true</hi> Kiſs of Charity, <hi>and in this ſence 'tis ſtill continued among</hi> Chriſtians: <hi>Moreover 'tis of it ſelf a thing indifferent, and only good as 'tis an indication of true Charity, and therefore is equivalently continued by all Acts of</hi> Chriſtian Charity. <hi>The</hi> Love Feaſts <hi>were deſigned for the Refreſhment of the Poor, by what the Rich brought to the</hi> Holy Sacrament <hi>to be eaten by them at that Feaſt of Love; and ſince it after happened through the looſeneſs of</hi> Chriſtians, <hi>that great Diſorders were com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted in thoſe Feaſts, they being made occaſions not of Diviſions only, but of Intemperance and Drunkenneſs, they were univerſally diſuſed in the Fourth Century, and converted into a more unexceptionable Charity to be diſtributed among the Poor; according to that never failing Rule, That where the abuſe is greater than the uſe of a Cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony, if the intended uſe may be obtained other wife,</hi> Abuſus tollit uſum, <hi>the abuſe makes it reaſonable to ceaſe the uſage of that Rite.</hi>

                  <p>Thirdly, <hi>If they have been univerſally neceived through the whole</hi> Chriſtian <hi>World, from the</hi> Apoſtles <hi>times unto our daies; not that the neglect of this Obſervation, by any</hi> Church <hi>in any Age or Ages, could have rendered this Ordinance invalid, or not obliging to Poſterity, but becauſe the continuance of it from the time of its firſt Practice or Inſtitution to this preſent moment, is a juſt Preſumption that all</hi> Chriſtians <hi>have been always ſatisfied, and well aſſured of their Obligation to comply with it, and that no</hi> Chriſtians <hi>can have any cauſe to vary from it.

                     <hi>That this Command to obſerve the</hi> Seventh day from the Creation <hi>could be no Moral Precept, obliging all Mankind, is evident,</hi> 1. <hi>From the Reaſons there aſſigned of it; Becauſe</hi> God having made the World in ſix days, reſted the ſeventh, <hi>and that</hi> therefore the Lord bleſſed the ſeventh day and hallow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed it. <hi>Now, evident it is, that no Man by the Light of Nature could diſcern that God imployed</hi> ſix days <hi>in the Creation of the World, or that he reſted on the ſeventh day only from his Labour;
<pb n="xxiij" facs="tcp:59808:115"/>no humane Reaſon could, with any certainty inferr, That becauſe he reſted from his Labour on this day, we ſhould reſt alſo on it; and ſo no Man, without a Revelation, could be acquainted with theſe Grounds for Obſervation of this day. Moreover no Man by the Light of Nature could know that Time ought rather to be computed by</hi> Weeks, <hi>or by the Number</hi> Seven, <hi>than any other Number, and much leſs that one day in ſeven preciſely, rather than in ten, ſhould be dedicated to God's</hi> Service; <hi>this being neither a principle evident in it ſelf, nor derivable from any thing that is ſo, and much leſs that the laſt of</hi> ſeven <hi>days ſhould be kept holy, rather than the firſt, or any other of the ſeven, no day being more holy than another by</hi> inherent Sanctity, <hi>but only by</hi> God's <hi>free and arbitrary injunction to apply it, or conſecrate it to Religious <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſes.

                     <hi>it ſeems a vulgar Error to conceive that God did chiefly and primarily command the</hi> Jews <hi>to reſt upon the Seventh day in imitation of his Reſt, there being nothing moral, or nothing in the Light of Nature which could induce them to imi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tate him in this matter any more than in the Work of the Six days preceeding, in which God worked; which was ſo far from laying any neceſſary Obligation on them to work upon thoſe days, that God him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf eſtabliſhed many other</hi> Feſtivals <hi>as a perpetual Ordinance, in which they were obliged to ceaſe from Labour on thoſe Days on which he Worked. Wherefore the great deſign of God, in requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring them to Reſt upon that day, as he did, was this, that by ſo doing they might acknowledge, as by a Sign and Pledge, That they did Worſhip and own him as their God in Covenant, who was the ſole Creator of the World, according to theſe Words of God to</hi> Moſes, Speak thou unto the Children of Iſrael, ſaying,

                     <hi>that the Reſt of that day might be violated to preſerve</hi> the life of a Beaſt, <hi>and much more to preſerve the life of man; that</hi> the Sabbath was made for man, and not man for the Sabbath, <hi>and therefore man might wave the

                  </p>
                  <p n="2">2ly. <hi>Tho' it were lawful, even when the Fourth Commandment was ſtill in force, to flee upon that day from danger, and travel up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on caſe of urgent neceſſity; yet many of the</hi> Jews <hi>thought otherwiſe, eſteeming this an intolerable profanation of the</hi> Sabbath, <hi>perſecuting, and condemning our Lord for teaching the contrary.

                           <hi>That there is no Evidence of Traditions for the Doctrines of the Church of</hi> Rome <hi>is proved;</hi> 1. <hi>Becauſe there is no mention of them in the ancient Councils, the</hi> Codex canonum Eccleſiae uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſalis, <hi>the Diſcourſes of the Ancients Church Government and Diſcipline, or in their Rituals,</hi> §. 1. 2. <hi>Becauſe we find no mention of their Articles of Faith in the Creeds, Enchriidions, Compendiums of Chriſtian Doctrine, and Eccleſiaſtical Opinions, or in the catechiſtical Diſcourſes of the ancient Fathers,</hi> §. 2. 3. <hi>Becauſe the Fathers of the firſt Ages were very careful and concerned to preſerve the Traditions of the Apostles truly ſo called, and ſo eſteemed by them, and had occaſion to mention them, by reaſon of the pretences of the Hereticks of their Times to Tradition, and yet they have not been concerned to preſerve the pretended tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditionary Doctrines and Practices of the Church of</hi> Rome, § 3.</p>

                     <p>HANING thus Stated the Queſtion in theſe propo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitions, I come now to ſhew, that there is no Evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence of <hi>Tradition</hi> for any, much leſs for all thoſe Doctrines of the <hi>Church</hi> of <hi>Rome,</hi> which ſhe hath put into her <hi>Creed,</hi> and hath required all her <hi>Clor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gy</hi> to believe and teach, as that <hi>true Catholick Faith without which no Man can be ſaved.</hi>

<pb n="4" facs="tcp:59808:128"/>with them in all their <hi>Summaries</hi> of <hi>Chriſtian Doctrine,</hi> of <hi>Eccle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiaſtical Doctrines,</hi> and their Diſcourſes writ on purpoſe to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruct others in the Articles of Chriſtian Faith, they would have been inſerted into their <hi>Creeds,</hi> as other neceſſary Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticles were, taught their <hi>Catechumens,</hi> required of their <hi>Clergy</hi> at their admiſſion to Holy Orders, ſent by their <hi>Patriarchs</hi> and <hi>Biſhops</hi> in their circular Letters, included in the <hi>Paſchal Cycles,</hi> as were the Rule of Faith, the <hi>Chriſtian Symbol;</hi> and yet by diligent peruſual of all theſe, we can find no ſuch matter in the <hi>Creeds, Enchiridions, Compendiums</hi> of <hi>Chriſtian Doctrine,</hi> the <hi>catechiſtical Diſcourſes,</hi> the Treatiſes of Faith, and <hi>eccleſiaſtical Doctrines,</hi> ſo frequent in the Writings of the five firſt Centuries; and therefore have good reaſon to believe they were not then received or owned as Articles of <hi>Chriſtian</hi> Faith.</p>
                     <p>The Wiſdom of the preſent <hi>Church</hi> of <hi>Rome</hi> yields a ſtrong confirmation of this Argument, for ſince their latter <hi>Councils</hi> have defined theſe Articles, we find them Inſerted into her <hi>Creed,</hi> and her <hi>Trent Catechiſm,</hi> contained in all the Writings of her <hi>Doctors,</hi> touching the Articles of <hi>Chriſtian</hi> Faith, and of <hi>eccleſiaſtical Tradition,</hi> required to be believed, profeſſed, and taught by all her <hi>Clergy.</hi> What therefore ſhall we think of all the <hi>Fathers</hi> of the five firſt <hi>Centuries,</hi> was it out of want of love to Souls, or care of their inſtruction, in the neceſſary Articles of <hi>Chriſtian</hi> Faith, that they were wholly ſilent in theſe mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters? Why then may we not fear that they neglected to hand down unto Poſterity other neceſſary <hi>Articles</hi> of <hi>Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian</hi> Faith? Or was it out of ignorance that they were then neceſſary, how then came <hi>Romanists</hi> to know by <hi>Tradition,</hi> that they are neceſſary now? Or, if they wanted neither knowledge to diſcern all neceſſary Articles of <hi>Chriſtian</hi> Faith, nor will, nor care to teach all they conceived to be ſuch, muſt it not follow, that thoſe Articles which in their nume<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous Diſcourſes and Inſtructions on theſe Subjects, are not ſo much as touched upon, were not then owned as neceſſary Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticles of the <hi>Chriſtian</hi> Faith, and therefore ought not now to be impoſed or received as ſuch?</p>

For is it reaſonable to think that the <hi>Apoſtles,</hi> the <hi>Apoſtolick
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:59808:141"/>Churches,</hi> or the four firſt <hi>General Councils</hi> were ſo forgetful as to omit any fundamental point in that <hi>Creed,</hi> which they delivered to be believed by all <hi>Chriſtians</hi> as the Rule of Faith? What account can be given why any ſuch ſummary of Faith ſhould be made at all by the <hi>Apoſtles,</hi> or their <hi>Succeſſors,</hi> but for this end, that in them all the neceſſary Articles of <hi>Chriſtian</hi> Faith might be comprized; if a <hi>Creed</hi> were ſuitably to this <hi>Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition,</hi> delivered by the <hi>Apoſtles</hi> to the <hi>Church,</hi> either we muſt think theſe <hi>Apoſtles</hi> unfaithful in their Work, or the <hi>Creed</hi> an unfaithful account of their Doctrine; or that all which they eſteemed ſimply neceſſary to be believed is comprized in it; for to imagine otherwiſe is in effect to ſay this is not the <hi>Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles Creed,</hi> but a part of it; but the <hi>Apoſtles,</hi> and the <hi>Church</hi> of the ſucceeding Ages giving it that name, ſeem plainly to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form us that the ſumm, and ſubſtance of their <hi>credenda</hi> was comprized in it. To deny this is in effect to ſay they dealt deceitfully, and were a ſnare to <hi>Chriſtians</hi> in compoſing of it; for to call it a <hi>Creed,</hi> and to leave out of it that which was neceſſarily to be believed, what had it been but to deceive the World, it being in effect to think that they had given us a Symbol which was indeed no Symbol, as being no diſtinctive mark betwixt the ſound Believer and the <hi>Heretick,</hi> or one that errs in Fundamentals, which yet the notion of the word <hi>Symbol</hi> doth import, and which the <hi>Ancients</hi> tell us this Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtolick Symbol was deſigned to be. In fine, it is to believe that the Compilers of this <hi>Creed</hi> would put in ſome things un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neceſſary to be believed in themſelves, only as being circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances of things neceſſary, as that our Saviour's Crucifixion happened under <hi>Pontius Pilate,</hi> his Reſurrection was on the <hi>Third Day,</hi> and yet would leave out ſome things which were ſimply to be believed of all Chriſtians. Moreover could the <hi>Apoſtles</hi> agree upon this as the Rule of what they afterwards ſhould preach, and as a Rule to be given to Believers, if it contained not <hi>the whole Council of God</hi> in things ſimply neceſſary to be believed; if ſo, it follows, that either they obſerved not their own Rule in Preaching of the <hi>Goſpel,</hi> or if they did, they kept back from the knowledge of the Faithful ſomething neceſſary to be believed unto Salvation.

                     </p>
                     <p>Hence then the Argument runs thus, If the Faith of <hi>Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians</hi> was equally contained in many other Doctrines, why did not the <hi>Church</hi> equally require her <hi>Clergy</hi> to teach them alſo to the People?

                     <argument>
                        <p>
                           <hi>Anſwer is given to the Arguments of Mr.</hi> M. <hi>for the Infallibility of Tradition, as,</hi> v. g. 1. <hi>That the World had no other Rule for the first Two thouſand Years,</hi> §. 1. <hi>Anſwered,</hi> 1ſt. <hi>by ſhewing that this proves not the thing in Queſtion, which is not, Whether nothing can come down unto us by Tradition; but, Whether in long tract of time, Men may not add to the Traditions which truly they received, others which falſly they pretend to be ſuch; and, Whether pretences to Tradition may not be juſtly ſcrupled, when ancient Records not only do ſay nothing of, but plainly contradict them,</hi> Ibid. 2dly. <hi>That this Argument contradicts the Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition of the</hi> Jews, <hi>touching the Precepts of</hi> Noah <hi>only impoſed upon the World before, and of the Chriſtians generally teaching Men were then guided by the Law, not of Tradition, but of na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,</hi> §. 2. <hi>The Inſtances contained in this Argument conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered,</hi> §. 3. 3dly. <hi>It is proved that both the</hi> Antediluvians <hi>and they who lived after the Flood were very prone to Idolatry; and that God therefore would not truſt them with any poſitive Precepts, but ſuch as were Recorded in a written Law,</hi> §. 4. <hi>Mr.</hi> M<hi>'s. Second Argument, That for above Two thouſand Years more from</hi> Moſes <hi>to</hi> Chriſt<hi>'s time the Church was go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verned partly by Writing, and partly by Tradition. Anſw.</hi> 1. <hi>The contrary is proved both from the Scriptures of the</hi> Old <hi>and the</hi> New Teſtament, §. 5. 2. <hi>That the Traditions which ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained in the</hi> Jewiſh <hi>Church were ſuch as tended to the Evacuation of the Law of</hi> Moſes <hi>the Introduction of vain Worſhip, and the renouncing of the true</hi> Meſſiah, §. 6. <hi>This is farther demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrated from the Scriptures of the</hi> New Teſtament <hi>and</hi> Joſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phus, §. 7. <hi>Mr.</hi> M's. <hi>Third Argument, That when the Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptures were given to the</hi> Jewiſh <hi>Church, all other Nations were guided only by Tradition, and yet had many true Believers among them, as</hi> Job, &amp;c. <hi>Anſw.</hi> 1. <hi>That the Scripture manifeſtly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clares, that the Heathens generally were guilty of Idolatry, and that God had given them a Law, not of Tradition, but of Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,</hi> §. 8.2. <hi>That</hi> Job <hi>and his Friends believed in one God, not by Tradition, but the Light of Nature, according to the Fathers,</hi> §. 9.3. <hi>That when Chriſtianity appeared, the great
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:59808:172"/>Plea of the Heathens for it was Tradition which they pleaded af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter the manner of the Romaniſts,</hi> §. 10. <hi>The Anſwer of the Chriſtians to this Plea is a full Juſtification of the Proteſtants, and a demonſtration that they were not Roman Catholicks in this Matter,</hi> §. 11. <hi>For,</hi> 1ſt. <hi>They repreſent it as the greateſt folly to preferr Cuſtom before Reaſon.</hi> 2ly. <hi>They add, That their Anceſtors were prone to receive Fables, and monſtrous Opinions for Truths, which alſo Romaniſts confeſs of the Writers of their Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stories.</hi> 3dly, <hi>That this was the Riſe of all their Errors, that they followed their Fathers without conſulting Truth.</hi> 4thly. <hi>That they who pleaded Antiquity were themſelves the greateſt Innovators.</hi> 5thly. <hi>That there was a time when the Heathen Religion was New,</hi> Ibid. <hi>In defence of their own Proceedings they declare,</hi> 1ſt. <hi>That it is the property of wiſe Men not to be enſlaved to their former Opinions.</hi> 2dly. <hi>That their Adverſaries ought not to run them down with preſcription or the belief of their Ance<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtors, but fairly come to the Merits of the Cauſe,</hi> §. 12. 3dly. <hi>That they ought not to be run down with multitude, that being no mark of the true Religion.</hi> 4thly. <hi>That they ought not to be called to yield a blind aſſent to the dictates of other Men, without uſing their own Judgments.</hi> 5thly. <hi>That their Separation from their fore-Fathers muſt be acknowledged Just and Righteous, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they could ſhew wherein they had erred.</hi> Laſtly, <hi>That their Religion was not New, but only it was lately that they knew it to be the true and old Religion,</hi> §. 13. Obj. 4. <hi>That before the</hi> New Teſtament <hi>was written and divulged all Chriſtians were governed by Tradition only,</hi> §. 14. Anſw. 1. <hi>That the Four Goſpels which were always judged ſufficiently to contain the Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian Doctrine, were writ ſoon after the Preaching of the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spel.</hi> 2. <hi>That till then the Apostles Preached only out of the</hi> Old Teſtament, <hi>and exhorted their Hearers to attend to it as their Rule,</hi> Ibid. 3. <hi>That the Tradition of the Primitive Church de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared it neceſſary that Scriptures ſhould be written to be to us a Rule of Faith,</hi> §. 15. <hi>Mr.</hi> M<hi>'s. Fourth Argument, that the Traditions of the Church of</hi> Rome <hi>may be as fully proved, as it can be proved to one that never ſaw</hi> London, <hi>that there is ſuch a City, and that it is the Capital City of this Kingdom, ſhewed to be highly vain,</hi> §. 16.</p>

                     <p>HAving thus ſhewed the uncertainty of <hi>Tradition</hi> in many Caſes, and proved that the <hi>Doctrines</hi> of the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> have not deſcended by <hi>Tradition</hi> from the <hi>Apostles,</hi> or the Primitive <hi>Church,</hi> I now proceed to Anſwer what Mr. <hi>M.</hi> doth offer to prove the certainty of <hi>Oral Tradition</hi> in the Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral, and of ſome <hi>Romiſh</hi> Doctrines in Particular,</p>

                     <p>R.

And theſe Laws,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>we may preſume were received from an external infallible Proponent, and were preſerved by the Eccleſiaſtical Superiors, and Teachers of theſe Laws in ſuch a manner as thoſe delivered ſince;</hi> and <hi>for the certainty of their Religion there ſeems an Infallibility in theſe, as neceſſary, if not more, for ſolving the great doubts
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:59808:173"/>ariſing therein before, as after the times of a written Law.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Such <hi>Arguments</hi> as this, and thoſe that follow, are not wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy of any conſideration by reaſon of their great impertinen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy, were it not upon this account, that it is eaſie to evince they are ſo far from being <hi>Arguments;</hi> for, that they are certain <hi>Demonſtrations</hi> againſt the certainty, and the <hi>Infallibi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity</hi> of the <hi>Traditions</hi> diſputed betwixt us and the <hi>Church</hi> of <hi>Rome,</hi> and plainly overthrow the Cauſe they were deſigned to main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain. To make this evident, let it be noted,</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>First,</hi> That the <hi>Controverſy</hi> betwixt us and the <hi>Church</hi> of <hi>Rome</hi> is not this, Whether any thing may be derived down to Poſterity by <hi>Tradition,</hi> for this we have confeſſed in many Caſes, and where <hi>Tradition</hi> from the beginning can undoubted<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly be had, we own it. But the <hi>Queſtion</hi> is, Whether they who own, or have <hi>Tradition</hi> for their <hi>Rule,</hi> may not add many things to that which truly was received by <hi>Tradition</hi> pretending falſly that they alſo were derived by <hi>Tradition</hi> to them: For if this may be ſo, the <hi>Church</hi> of <hi>Rome</hi> may alſo own at preſent <hi>Tradition</hi> for her <hi>Rule,</hi> and yet with the like falſhood may pretend that many Doctrines and Practices deſcended by a <hi>Primitive Tradition</hi> to her; and the <hi>Traditions</hi> here enumerated may alſo truly bear that name, and yet the very ſame perſons may have handed down at the ſame time many other Practices and Doctrines under the ſame pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence, which tended to corrupt the Faith and Manners of thoſe very Ages.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Secondly,</hi> The great Enquiry is, Whether in tract of time, <hi>viz.</hi> the ſpace of <hi>Sixteen hundred</hi> Years, ſuch Doctrines, and practices may not be admitted and owned as <hi>Primitive Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditions</hi> by a prevailing party of <hi>Gentiles, Jews</hi> or <hi>Chriſtians,</hi> which were nothing leſs than ſo. For if this hath been actu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally ſo before, and after the writing of the <hi>Law</hi> of <hi>Moſes,</hi> and alſo ſince the publication of the <hi>Goſpel,</hi> then may the Doctrines and Practices of the <hi>Church</hi> of <hi>Rome</hi> in ſo long tract of time, be thus admitted, and yet be nothing leſs than <hi>Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitive Traditions.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>And, <hi>Thirdly,</hi> Whether Pretences to <hi>Tradition</hi> may not juſtly be ſuſpected, when <hi>ancient Records,</hi> which had equal reaſon to take notice of them, and could not have condemned what the whole <hi>Church</hi> received as a Divine Verity, not only
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:59808:174"/>do ſay nothing of, but plainly contradict them. Having pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſed theſe things, I anſwer;</p>

                        <hi>Firſt,</hi> Mr. <hi>M.</hi> is miſerably out in this <hi>Diſcourſe,</hi> for not one of theſe <hi>Revelations</hi> here mentioned, whatſoever is the import of them, have deſcended to us by <hi>Oral Tradition,</hi> but are all of them contained in <hi>Scripture</hi> as far as they are truly cited.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Secondly,</hi> Whereas the Evidence that there is ſuch a <hi>City</hi> as <hi>London,</hi> is ſo great, that never any Body could deny, or que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtion it; that the <hi>Church</hi> is <hi>Infallible</hi> in propounding any Point of Faith, not clearly revealed in the <hi>Holy Scripture,</hi> or that there are indeed any ſuch Points of Faith, is at preſent, and hath been formerly denied by many <hi>Myriads</hi> of learned and pious Men, whoſe worldly Intereſt it is, and was to believe that true which they deny to be ſo, and whoſe rejoicement it would be to find it true, and that none of the places here produced prove this <hi>Infallibility,</hi> or by the <hi>Primitive Profeſſors</hi> of <hi>Chriſtianity</hi> were eſteemed to prove it, they have unanimouſly held, and do at preſent hold.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Thirdly,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Ibid.</note> Whereas he ſaith, <hi>He did ſee with his Eyes that ſhe</hi> (viz. the <hi>Church</hi> of God) <hi>did propoſe her Traditions for Verities
<pb n="127" facs="tcp:59808:189"/>received from God.</hi> Let it be noted, That Mr. <hi>M.</hi> confounds the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> and the Church of <hi>God,</hi> excluding all the <hi>Proteſtants,</hi> the <hi>Greek Church,</hi> and the <hi>Eaſtern Chriſtians,</hi> not ſubject to the <hi>Pope,</hi> from that <hi>Church, out of which there is no Salvation,</hi> (which, I hope, is not ſo evident, as that there is ſuch a <hi>City</hi> as <hi>London,</hi>) for it is not the whole <hi>Church,</hi> but that of <hi>Rome,</hi> which claims this <hi>Infallibility,</hi> and on that account propoſeth her <hi>Traditions</hi> for Verities received from God. Now then let us return to our <hi>Capital City</hi> of <hi>London,</hi> and we ſhall find the whole Nation, though of different Parties, Inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſts, and Judgments, agreeing that there is in <hi>England</hi> ſuch a <hi>Capital City</hi> as <hi>London,</hi> but yet we find half the whole <hi>Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian</hi> World utterly denying many <hi>Traditions</hi> of the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> to be Verities received from God, and in particular that of the <hi>Pope</hi>'s <hi>Supremacy,</hi> without which the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> neither doth nor can pretend to be the whole <hi>Church Catholick.</hi> Now this denial of her pretended Traditions by ſo many <hi>Churches,</hi> profeſſing a like Veneration for thoſe <hi>Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditions</hi> which are truly <hi>Primitive,</hi> muſt prove as ſtrongly, that the <hi>Traditions</hi> of the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> are falſly ſo cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led, as her <hi>Aſſertion</hi> can be ſuppoſed to prove them <hi>Divine Verities.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Again, whereas there are no univerſally received <hi>Records</hi> which give us the leaſt cauſe to doubt whether there be ſuch a <hi>City</hi> as <hi>London, &amp;c.</hi> the <hi>Records</hi> of the <hi>Scriptures, Councils,</hi> and <hi>Fathers</hi> of the <hi>Church,</hi> cauſe many <hi>Myriads</hi> to believe the Doctrines and Practices peculiar to the <hi>Roman Church,</hi> are ſo far from being <hi>Apoſtolical Traditions,</hi> that they are plainly op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſite to the Doctrines, Practices, and Traditions formerly received, and approved in the Church of <hi>Chriſt;</hi> and this they do believe ſo firmly, that they rather chuſe to ſuffer loſs of Life, and all the Comforts of it, than own theſe Doctrines of the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> as <hi>Apostolical Traditions.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Moreover, whereas it is no Man's Intereſt to make the World believe there was ſuch a <hi>City</hi> as <hi>London,</hi> if there was no ſuch place in being, it is the Intereſt of the whole <hi>Church</hi> of <hi>Rome</hi> to ſet up this pretence to <hi>Infallibility</hi> in the <hi>General,</hi> that finding it diſclaimed by other <hi>Churches,</hi> ſhe with ſome Colour may pretend unto it; and 'tis the Intereſt of the <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man Clergy,</hi> as much to ſtickle for the Truth of her <hi>pretended
<pb n="128" facs="tcp:59808:190"/>Traditions,</hi> as it was the Intereſt of <hi>Demetrius,</hi> and his Fellow Artiſts, to avouch to the <hi>Epheſians, They might be truly Gods which were made by Hands;</hi> and that the <hi>Image</hi> of <hi>Diana</hi> truly <hi>fell down from Jupiter,</hi> ſince otherwiſe <hi>their Craft would be ſet at nought.</hi> And as it was the Intereſt of the <hi>Maſter</hi> of the <hi>Pythoniſſe</hi> to be angry with St. <hi>Paul</hi> for caſting out the <hi>Evil Spirit</hi> from her, becauſe thereby <hi>his Hopes of Gain was gone;</hi> For if Men will not receive their <hi>Traditions</hi> as the Truths of God, they cannot <hi>Lord it over their Conſciences,</hi> nor drain their Purſes, nor give Laws at pleaſure to the <hi>Chriſtian</hi> World, but muſt be put to the hard task of proving what they would have us take upon their Words.</p>
                     <p>And, <hi>Fourthly,</hi> Whereas he that doubteth whether there be ſuch a <hi>City</hi> as <hi>London,</hi> may repair unto it to be convinced by ocular demonſtration, whither ſhall he repair who doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth of the Truth of the <hi>Traditions</hi> of the <hi>Church</hi> of <hi>Rome</hi> for Satisfaction in that Matter? Will you ſend him to <hi>Scripture?</hi> You have already told him he cannot know what is <hi>Scripture,</hi> what <hi>Copies,</hi> and what <hi>Texts</hi> are uncorrupted, what <hi>Tranſla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi> of it is <hi>Authentick,</hi> but by the <hi>Church;</hi> and alſo, that when he knows all this, he cannot underſtand the meaning of the <hi>Scriptures</hi> in places diſputable, and variouſly ſenſed, as you know thoſe are by which you prove both the <hi>Churches Infallibility,</hi> and the Pretences of the <hi>Roman Church</hi> to be In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fallible.</p>

                     <p>
                        <hi>Thirdly,</hi> Hence it is evident that the Practice of the <hi>Church</hi> in any <hi>Century,</hi> is no true Ground for the Interpretation of the <hi>Holy Scripture;</hi> ſeeing this Practice of communicating <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fants</hi> was built upon the Miſtake of the <hi>Church</hi> of the Ages mentioned touching the true Sence of thoſe Words, <hi>Except you eat the Fleſh of the Son of Man, and drink his Blood, you have no Life in you.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Fourthly,</hi> Hence it is evident, That if the preſent <hi>Church</hi> of any Age muſt be the infallible Judge of what is <hi>Tradition;</hi> if what is generally received in any Age muſt be derived from the <hi>Apoſtles,</hi> the Cuſtom of giving the Sacrament to <hi>Children</hi> for the Remiſſion of Sins, and the obtaining Life, muſt be an <hi>Apoſtolical Tradition,</hi> it being generally received for <hi>Six Centu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries;</hi> and yet if the <hi>Church</hi> of <hi>Rome,</hi> of the Three laſt Ages, was the Judge of what deſerved to be eſteemed <hi>Tradition,</hi> the ſelf ſame Doctrine being then generally rejected by them, could be no <hi>Apoſtolical Tradition.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Fifthly,</hi> Hence Mr. <hi>M.</hi> may learn, that his Proof of Prayer for the Dead, and <hi>Infants Baptiſm</hi> from <hi>Tradition,</hi> is not very weighty and convincing; or if it be, the Cuſtom of <hi>commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicating Infants</hi> muſt be <hi>Tradition Apoſtolical.</hi> For changing only the Subject, it will be eaſy to argue for it after the man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, and in the Words of Mr. <hi>M. Let us take Two Traditions,
<note place="margin">P. 401.</note> the one confeſſed by you to be a true one, the other</hi> indeed con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned by you, <hi>but aſſerted by me to be no leſs true than the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer, becauſe it is teſtified by as good a Tradition as the former, and therefore either the former is not proved ſufficiently by this Teſtimony, or the latter is. The First Tradition, for Example
<pb n="142" facs="tcp:59808:197"/>ſake, is, That of Baptizing Infants:</hi> The Second, That of the <hi>Communicating</hi> of <hi>Infants. Of theſe Two I diſcourſe thus; Both theſe Points were recommended by the Apoſtles to the Primitive Church, for divine Verities and Practices; and ſo from hand to hand came moſt unquestionably delivered to</hi> the Twelfth <hi>Century.

<note place="margin">P. 403.</note> For Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample, the Apocalypſe, which was rejected by divers Ancient Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholicks, whereas</hi> the <hi>Communion</hi> of <hi>Infants was never rejected by any Ancient Catholicks at all,</hi> nor by any of them ſaid to be unneceſſary. <hi>Amongſt ancient Hereticks,</hi> the <hi>Pelagians,</hi> indeed, ſaid, That it was not neceſſary to communicate them for the Remiſſion of Sins; <hi>but this is noted in them as a peculiar Hereſy of their own,</hi> by Pope <hi>Innocent,</hi> by <hi>Pelagius,</hi> by the <hi>Council</hi> of <hi>Carthage,</hi> and by St. <hi>Auſtin,</hi> who pronounceth againſt them, That <hi>Infants ought to be communicated for the Remiſſion of Sins:</hi> And the ſame St. <hi>Auſtin</hi> ſaith, <hi>The Church doth neceſſarily do this by the Tradition,
<note place="margin">P. 404.</note> as he fuppoſeth, Apoſtolical, received from her Anceſtors. He held therefore</hi> ſuch Communion of Infants, <hi>ſuitable to the Doctrine of the Church, and Tradition. And this Tradition is that which I now ſtand upon, which indeed did ſhine in the Practice of the Primitive Church. You ſhall ſcarcely find a Liturgy or Service Book uſed in the ancient Church; which is not Witneſs of this Tradition, though theſe Books were found in every Pariſh of Christendom, in which Divine Service was almoſt daily ſaid.</hi>
                        <note place="margin">P. 405.</note> St. <hi>Cyprian</hi> mentions it as the Practice of his Times: <hi>In both theſe Points it is a ſtrong Argument, and as ſtrong for Communicating, as for Baptizing of Infants; That no time can be
<pb n="143" facs="tcp:59808:197"/>named in which thoſe Customs began. No man can be thought of, who could by humane Means, and ſuch Means as ſhould not make a mighty Noiſe amongſt thoſe great Reverencers of Tradition, draw all the World, in ſo ſhort a time after the Apoſtles,
<note place="margin">P. 406.</note> to fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low Cuſtoms as Apoſtolical, which, in that Age, in which they were firſt vented, were evidently, by every Man, not only known, but clearly ſeen to be new hatch'd Novelties, and not Ancient and A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtolical Traditions. This Man, who broached this falſe Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine, ſhould have been put into the Catalogues of Hereticks by</hi> E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piphanius, <hi>and St.</hi> Auſtin; <hi>whereas they did not only, not put down any ſuch Hereticks, but one of them puts down</hi> Pelagius <hi>for one, becauſe he taught the contrary. Now if you ſpeak of this Cuſtom going downward, until the Age in which it began to be denied by Roman Catholicks, the Cuſtom of</hi> Communicating Infants <hi>hath come down with ſuch a full Stream, that it drew all Countries, in many Ages, with it; inſomuch, that every where, but among a few</hi> late born <hi>Romaniſts, the Pontificals, the Books of Sacraments, the Liturgies, Eaſtern and Weſtern,</hi> all the <hi>Ritualiſts,</hi> all the Books of <hi>Eccleſiaſtical Diſcipline,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">P. 407.</note> and even the <hi>Canon Law</hi> bears witneſs of it. <hi>There was not a Country which abounded not with ſuch Monuments, and ſuch Records; the very ſtrongeſt Proofs of aſſured Antiquity, and unqueſtionable Tradition.</hi>
